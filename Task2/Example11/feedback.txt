- Uses a LUT. I'm not convinced of the value of this.
- Uses prompted std-in rather than command line (does not follow spec)
- Reports erros to cout not cin
- Excessive #includes
- It'll fall over pretty hard if you try find primes that factors over 1433^2

- Can only test up to 2.05M (1433*1433) - NOT 1433^1433 as he states
- 2053489 (1433*1433) tests as prime (off by one error)
+ Better than raw brute force, not as good as a sieve
