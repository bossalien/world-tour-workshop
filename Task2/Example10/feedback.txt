- non-optimal SOE
+ error checking in place for bounds entry, comments and attribution.
+ this is a pass for me.

- The question asks for "command line arguments" but he uses the standard input stream.

- No command line arguments, which is very clear in the spec.
- Returns error code 1 every time.
+ Looks thorough otherwise.

-- Doesn't follow specification, in taking 2 command line arguments for lower and upper bounds.
+ Implemented Sieve of Eratosthenes.
+ Called out disadvantages of algorithm, and talked about Sieve of Atkin (but choose Eratosthenes due to time constraints).
+ Separation of input and generation, main() shows high level flow.
- Output is done during processing.
- Poor validation of inputs.
++ Logic is very clear and simple. No nonsense.
-- Lots of intermediate files hanging around in his deliverable, didn't clean his projects before sending them.
