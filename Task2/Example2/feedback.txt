- About as brute force as it gets, I find it hard to read but I think it'll work.
- Initial error checking is weird.
- Comments are wrong (set x and y values to 3 ... then only sets x) but don't impact the end result.
- We asked for params passed on the commandline, but range is hardcoded to 2..1000

- Program has hard coded range to work over
- Fairly nasty brute force

 - Fails to meet input specification
 - Fails to meet execution specification on Task 1 and Task 2 (both in one app).
 - Barely an improvement on brute force for Task 2.
