- Fails to find primes over 17923 (doesn't crash, but still, thats quite a low arbitrary upper limit).

- Arbitrary limit on primes (for no good reason).
- Brute force, no optimisation at all.
- Likely crash if you ask for a large enough number.
- This is a fail for me with my standard test case (50,000)
