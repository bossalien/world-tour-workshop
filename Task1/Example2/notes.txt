0) What are the issues with this one?
	* Are all the number requested in the spec printed?
		- 0 is excluded but 0 is a multiple of 3 and 5.
			Common mistake coming from confusion between division of and division by 0
		- Also why checking against 0 when looping on it

	* Are the number on single lines?
		- No cout << endl; after line 16

	* Will this compile on most architectures?
		- It won't compile because of specific VS imports
		* How would you fix this?
			- Test your program on as many platforms as you can
			- Remove _tmain, _TCHAR

	* What about the for range? (not a fail)
		- i < 31 makes the program more confusing (and far from the problem spec)

	- Use ternary operator which makes it less readable and
		doing arbitrary amount of work you don't need to do
		for the else case
