	* Can you guys see the problems here?
		- Incorrectly outputs the result for 0
		- Incorrectly outputs for 3 and 5
		- Misses multiples of 15 (else if insted of separated if)

	* Bad usage of comments
		- Comments are good but not for obvious statements or language features
		- A good comment is somethign that explain
			something that the code itself is not fully clear
		- Of course self explanatory code is always preferrable
